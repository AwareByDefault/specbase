# OpenSpec Conventions Specification

## Purpose

OpenSpec conventions SHALL define how system capabilities are documented, how changes are proposed and tracked, and how specifications evolve over time. This meta-specification serves as the source of truth for OpenSpec's own conventions.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Structured conventions for specs and changes

OpenSpec conventions SHALL mandate a structured spec format with clear requirement and scenario sections so tooling can parse consistently.

#### Scenario: Following the structured spec format

- **WHEN** writing or updating OpenSpec specifications
- **THEN** authors SHALL use `### Requirement: ...` followed by at least one `#### Scenario: ...` section

### Requirement: Behavior-First Specification Boundary
OpenSpec specifications SHALL capture verifiable behavior contracts and avoid internal implementation detail.

#### Scenario: Writing behavior requirements
- **WHEN** documenting a capability in `spec.md`
- **THEN** requirements focus on externally observable behavior, interfaces, error handling, and constraints
- **AND** scenarios remain testable or explicitly verifiable

#### Scenario: Avoiding implementation leakage
- **WHEN** details involve concrete library choices, class/function structure, or execution mechanics
- **THEN** those details SHALL be documented in `design.md` or `tasks.md` instead of behavioral requirements

### Requirement: Progressive Rigor
OpenSpec conventions SHALL keep specs lightweight by default and scale rigor only when risk or coordination complexity demands it.

#### Scenario: Routine change specification
- **WHEN** a change is local and low-risk
- **THEN** authors use concise, behavior-first requirements with minimal ceremony

#### Scenario: High-risk or cross-boundary change specification
- **WHEN** a change is cross-team, cross-repo, API-contract breaking, migration-heavy, or security/privacy sensitive
- **THEN** authors increase detail and explicit validation expectations proportionally

### Requirement: Project Structure
An OpenSpec project SHALL maintain a consistent directory structure for specifications and changes.

#### Scenario: Initializing project structure
- **WHEN** an OpenSpec project is initialized
- **THEN** it SHALL have this structure:
```
openspec/
├── project.md              # Project-specific context
├── AGENTS.md               # AI assistant instructions
├── specs/                  # Current deployed capabilities
│   └── [capability]/       # Single, focused capability
│       ├── spec.md         # WHAT and WHY
│       └── design.md       # HOW (optional, for established patterns)
└── changes/                # Proposed changes
    ├── [change-name]/      # Descriptive change identifier
    │   ├── proposal.md     # Why, what, and impact
    │   ├── tasks.md        # Implementation checklist
    │   ├── design.md       # Technical decisions (optional)
    │   └── specs/          # Complete future state
    │       └── [capability]/
    │           └── spec.md # Clean markdown (no diff syntax)
    └── archive/            # Completed changes
        └── YYYY-MM-DD-[name]/
```

### Requirement: Structured Format for Behavioral Specs

Behavioral specifications SHALL use a structured format with consistent section headers and keywords to ensure visual consistency and parseability.

#### Scenario: Writing requirement sections

- **WHEN** documenting a requirement in a behavioral specification
- **THEN** use a level-3 heading with format `### Requirement: [Name]`
- **AND** immediately follow with a SHALL statement describing core behavior
- **AND** keep requirement names descriptive and under 50 characters

#### Scenario: Documenting scenarios

- **WHEN** documenting specific behaviors or use cases
- **THEN** use level-4 headings with format `#### Scenario: [Description]`
- **AND** use bullet points with bold keywords for steps:
  - **GIVEN** for initial state (optional)
  - **WHEN** for conditions or triggers
  - **THEN** for expected outcomes
  - **AND** for additional outcomes or conditions

#### Scenario: Adding implementation details

- **WHEN** a step requires additional detail
- **THEN** use sub-bullets under the main step
- **AND** maintain consistent indentation
  - Sub-bullets provide examples or specifics
  - Keep sub-bullets concise

### Requirement: Header-Based Requirement Identification

Requirement headers SHALL serve as unique identifiers for programmatic matching between current specs and proposed changes.

#### Scenario: Matching requirements programmatically

- **WHEN** processing delta changes
- **THEN** use the `### Requirement: [Name]` header as the unique identifier
- **AND** match using normalized headers: `normalize(header) = trim(header)`
- **AND** compare headers with case-sensitive equality after normalization

#### Scenario: Handling requirement renames

- **WHEN** renaming a requirement
- **THEN** use a special `## RENAMED Requirements` section
- **AND** specify both old and new names explicitly:
  ```markdown
  ## RENAMED Requirements
  - FROM: `### Requirement: Old Name`
  - TO: `### Requirement: New Name`
  ```
- **AND** if content also changes, include under MODIFIED using the NEW header

#### Scenario: Validating header uniqueness

- **WHEN** creating or modifying requirements
- **THEN** ensure no duplicate headers exist within a spec
- **AND** validation tools SHALL flag duplicate headers as errors

### Requirement: Change Storage Convention

Change proposals SHALL store only the additions, modifications, and removals to specifications, not complete future states.

#### Scenario: Creating change proposals with additions

- **WHEN** creating a change proposal that adds new requirements
- **THEN** include only the new requirements under `## ADDED Requirements`
- **AND** each requirement SHALL include its complete content
- **AND** use the standard structured format for requirements and scenarios

#### Scenario: Creating change proposals with modifications  

- **WHEN** creating a change proposal that modifies existing requirements
- **THEN** include the modified requirements under `## MODIFIED Requirements`
- **AND** use the same header text as in the current spec (normalized)
- **AND** include the complete modified requirement (not a diff)
- **AND** optionally annotate what changed with inline comments like `← (was X)`

#### Scenario: Creating change proposals with removals

- **WHEN** creating a change proposal that removes requirements
- **THEN** list them under `## REMOVED Requirements`
- **AND** use the normalized header text for identification
- **AND** include reason for removal
- **AND** document any migration path if applicable

The `changes/[name]/specs/` directory SHALL contain:
- Delta files showing only what changes
- Sections for ADDED, MODIFIED, REMOVED, and RENAMED requirements
- Normalized header matching for requirement identification
- Complete requirements using the structured format
- Clear indication of change type for each requirement

#### Scenario: Using standard output symbols

- **WHEN** displaying delta operations in CLI output
- **THEN** use these standard symbols:
  - `+` for ADDED (green)
  - `~` for MODIFIED (yellow)
  - `-` for REMOVED (red)
  - `→` for RENAMED (cyan)

### Requirement: Archive Process Enhancement

The archive process SHALL programmatically apply delta changes to current specifications using header-based matching.

#### Scenario: Archiving changes with deltas

- **WHEN** archiving a completed change
- **THEN** the archive command SHALL:
  1. Parse RENAMED sections first and apply renames
  2. Parse REMOVED sections and remove by normalized header match
  3. Parse MODIFIED sections and replace by normalized header match (using new names if renamed)
  4. Parse ADDED sections and append new requirements
- **AND** validate that all MODIFIED/REMOVED headers exist in current spec
- **AND** validate that ADDED headers don't already exist
- **AND** generate the updated spec in the main specs/ directory

#### Scenario: Handling conflicts during archive

- **WHEN** delta changes conflict with current spec state
- **THEN** the archive command SHALL report specific conflicts
- **AND** require manual resolution before proceeding
- **AND** provide clear guidance on resolving conflicts

### Requirement: Proposal Format

Proposals SHALL explicitly document all changes with clear from/to comparisons.

#### Scenario: Documenting changes

- **WHEN** documenting what changes
- **THEN** the proposal SHALL explicitly describe each change:

```markdown
**[Section or Behavior Name]**
- From: [current state/requirement]
- To: [future state/requirement]
- Reason: [why this change is needed]
- Impact: [breaking/non-breaking, who's affected]
```

This explicit format compensates for not having inline diffs and ensures reviewers understand exactly what will change.

### Requirement: Change Review

The system SHALL support multiple methods for reviewing proposed changes.

#### Scenario: Reviewing changes

- **WHEN** reviewing proposed changes
- **THEN** reviewers can compare using:
- GitHub PR diff view when changes are committed
- Command line: `diff -u specs/[capability]/spec.md changes/[name]/specs/[capability]/spec.md`
- Any visual diff tool comparing current vs future state

### Requirement: Structured Format Adoption

Behavioral specifications SHALL adopt the structured format with `### Requirement:` and `#### Scenario:` headers as the default.

#### Scenario: Use structured headings for behavior

- **WHEN** documenting behavioral requirements
- **THEN** use `### Requirement:` for requirements
- **AND** use `#### Scenario:` for scenarios with bold WHEN/THEN/AND keywords

### Requirement: Verb–Noun CLI Command Structure
OpenSpec CLI design SHALL use verbs as top-level commands with nouns provided as arguments or flags for scoping.

#### Scenario: Verb-first command discovery
- **WHEN** a user runs a command like `openspec list`
- **THEN** the verb communicates the action clearly
- **AND** nouns refine scope via flags or arguments (e.g., `--changes`, `--specs`)

#### Scenario: Backward compatibility for noun commands
- **WHEN** users run noun-prefixed commands such as `openspec spec ...` or `openspec change ...`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL continue to support them for at least one release
- **AND** display a deprecation warning that points to verb-first alternatives

#### Scenario: Disambiguation guidance
- **WHEN** item names are ambiguous between changes and specs
- **THEN** `openspec show` and `openspec validate` SHALL accept `--type spec|change`
- **AND** the help text SHALL document this clearly

### Requirement: Agents plane conventions

The governed conventions SHALL document the `agents` plane as an opt-in plane whose members are a repository's own agentic instruments, distinct from the product-describing planes (behavior, architecture, ops, code-quality). The conventions SHALL state that the `agents` plane is offered at `init` and appended per-project, not shipped in the resolved default plane set.

#### Scenario: Conventions describe the plane

- **WHEN** an author reads the governed conventions to classify a spec
- **THEN** the conventions describe the `agents` plane, its instruments-not-behavior membership, and its opt-in, per-project nature

### Requirement: Spec-versus-operational-artifact rule

The conventions SHALL state that an `agents`-plane spec is durable truth *about* an agent-operational artifact (`config.yaml`, `DEFAULT_LENSES`, a `SKILL.md`, a hook) and is paired with a conformance/drift binding to that artifact, and that the plane introduces no new enforcement mechanism.

#### Scenario: Author learns the conformance pattern

- **WHEN** an author authors an `agents`-plane spec and its enforcement
- **THEN** the conventions direct them to bind the spec to its operational artifact via an existing `command` or `test` mechanism asserting conformance

### Requirement: Describe-not-generate and init-scaffold exception

The conventions SHALL state that an `agents`-plane spec describes the artifact the runtime reads and asserts conformance rather than generating it, and that `init` may plant baseline `agents` specs directly as scaffolding — the one documented exception to the proposal→spec→archive flow — while all later edits go through the change flow.

#### Scenario: Author learns direction and exception

- **WHEN** an author reads the conventions for the `agents` plane
- **THEN** the conventions state the DESCRIBE direction of truth and the init-scaffold exception, and that subsequent edits use the normal change flow

### Requirement: Design-system plane authoring conventions

The conventions SHALL define the `design-system` plane: its membership is durable truth about a product's expressed identity (visual tokens, design principles, copy voice/tone), not product behavior. Authors SHALL place token truths under `design-system/tokens/…` using the DESCRIBE direction (the token artifact remains the runtime source of truth; the spec describes its contract and binds automated checks) and voice/principle truths under `design-system/voice/…` bound to the `design` review lens.

#### Scenario: Identity truth is distinguished from behavior

- **WHEN** an author must decide between `behavior` and `design-system` for a copy-tone or visual-token truth
- **THEN** the conventions direct presentation/identity truths to `design-system` and functional-outcome truths to `behavior`

#### Scenario: DESCRIBE direction is documented for tokens

- **WHEN** an author writes a `design-system/tokens/*` spec
- **THEN** the conventions state that the spec describes the token artifact's contract rather than mastering the token values

### Requirement: Governance is emergent from plane selection

The conventions SHALL document that a project is governed when it resolves one or more planes and flat when it resolves none, and that `specModel.kind` is derived from the resolved plane set rather than chosen independently.

#### Scenario: Conventions describe emergent governance

- **WHEN** a reader consults the conventions for how a project becomes governed
- **THEN** the conventions state that selecting one or more planes at init makes the project governed, and selecting none leaves it flat
