# cli-validate Specification

## Purpose
Define `openspec validate` behavior for validating changes and specs with actionable remediation guidance and structured output.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Validation SHALL provide actionable remediation steps
Validation output SHALL include specific guidance to fix each error, including expected structure, example headers, and suggested commands to verify fixes.

#### Scenario: No deltas found in change
- **WHEN** validating a change with zero parsed deltas
- **THEN** show error "No deltas found" with guidance:
  - Explain that change specs must include `## ADDED Requirements`, `## MODIFIED Requirements`, `## REMOVED Requirements`, or `## RENAMED Requirements`
  - Remind authors that files must live under `openspec/changes/{id}/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
  - Include an explicit note: "Spec delta files cannot start with titles before the operation headers"
  - Suggest running `openspec change show {id} --json --deltas-only` for debugging

#### Scenario: Missing required sections
- **WHEN** a required section is missing
- **THEN** include expected header names and a minimal skeleton:
  - For Spec: `## Purpose`, `## Requirements`
  - For Change: `## Why`, `## What Changes`
  - Provide an example snippet of the missing section with placeholder prose ready to copy
  - Mention the quick-reference section in `openspec/AGENTS.md` as the authoritative template

#### Scenario: Missing requirement descriptive text
- **WHEN** a requirement header lacks descriptive text before scenarios
- **THEN** emit an error explaining that `### Requirement:` lines must be followed by narrative text before any `#### Scenario:` headers
  - Show compliant example: "### Requirement: Foo" followed by "The system SHALL ..."
  - Suggest adding 1-2 sentences describing the normative behavior prior to listing scenarios
  - Reference the pre-validation checklist in `openspec/AGENTS.md`

### Requirement: Validator SHALL detect likely misformatted scenarios and warn with a fix
The validator SHALL recognize bulleted lines that look like scenarios (e.g., lines beginning with WHEN/THEN/AND) and emit a targeted warning with a conversion example to `#### Scenario:`.

#### Scenario: Bulleted WHEN/THEN under a Requirement
- **WHEN** bullets that start with WHEN/THEN/AND are found under a requirement without any `#### Scenario:` headers
- **THEN** emit warning: "Scenarios must use '#### Scenario:' headers", and show a conversion template:
```
#### Scenario: Short name
- **WHEN** ...
- **THEN** ...
- **AND** ...
```

### Requirement: All issues SHALL include file paths and structured locations
Error, warning, and info messages SHALL include:
- Source file path (`openspec/changes/{id}/proposal.md`, `.../specs/{cap}/spec.md`)
- Structured path (e.g., `deltas[0].requirements[0].scenarios`)

#### Scenario: Zod validation error
- **WHEN** a schema validation fails
- **THEN** the message SHALL include `file`, `path`, and a remediation hint if applicable

### Requirement: Invalid results SHALL include a Next steps footer in human-readable output
The CLI SHALL append a Next steps footer when the item is invalid and not using `--json`, including:
- Summary line with counts
- Top-3 guidance bullets (contextual to the most frequent or blocking errors)
- A suggestion to re-run with `--json` and/or the debug command

#### Scenario: Change invalid summary
- **WHEN** a change validation fails
- **THEN** print "Next steps" with 2-3 targeted bullets and suggest `openspec change show <id> --json --deltas-only`

### Requirement: Top-level validate command

The CLI SHALL provide a top-level `validate` command for validating changes and specs with flexible selection options.

#### Scenario: Interactive validation selection

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate` without arguments
- **THEN** prompt user to select what to validate (all, changes, specs, or specific item)
- **AND** perform validation based on selection
- **AND** display results with appropriate formatting

#### Scenario: Non-interactive environments do not prompt

- **GIVEN** stdin is not a TTY or `--no-interactive` is provided or environment variable `OPEN_SPEC_INTERACTIVE=0`
- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate` without arguments
- **THEN** do not prompt interactively
- **AND** print a helpful hint listing available commands/flags and exit with code 1

#### Scenario: Direct item validation

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate <item-name>`
- **THEN** automatically detect if item is a change or spec
- **AND** validate the specified item
- **AND** display validation results

### Requirement: Bulk and filtered validation

The validate command SHALL support flags for bulk validation (--all) and filtered validation by type (--changes, --specs).

#### Scenario: Validate everything

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --all`
- **THEN** validate all changes in openspec/changes/ (excluding archive)
- **AND** validate all specs in openspec/specs/
- **AND** display a summary showing passed/failed items
- **AND** exit with code 1 if any validation fails

#### Scenario: Scope of bulk validation

- **WHEN** validating with `--all` or `--changes`
- **THEN** include all change proposals under `openspec/changes/`
- **AND** exclude the `openspec/changes/archive/` directory

- **WHEN** validating with `--specs`
- **THEN** include all specs that have a `spec.md` under `openspec/specs/<id>/spec.md`

#### Scenario: Validate all changes

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --changes`
- **THEN** validate all changes in openspec/changes/ (excluding archive)
- **AND** display results for each change
- **AND** show summary statistics

#### Scenario: Validate all specs

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --specs`
- **THEN** validate all specs in openspec/specs/
- **AND** display results for each spec
- **AND** show summary statistics

### Requirement: Validation options and progress indication

The validate command SHALL support standard validation options (--strict, --json) and display progress during bulk operations.

#### Scenario: Strict validation

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --all --strict`
- **THEN** apply strict validation to all items
- **AND** treat warnings as errors
- **AND** fail if any item has warnings or errors

#### Scenario: JSON output

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --all --json`
- **THEN** output validation results as JSON
- **AND** include detailed issues for each item
- **AND** include summary statistics

#### Scenario: JSON output schema for bulk validation

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --all --json` (or `--changes` / `--specs`)
- **THEN** output a JSON object with the following shape:
  - `items`: Array of objects with fields `{ id: string, type: "change"|"spec", valid: boolean, issues: Issue[], durationMs: number }`
  - `summary`: Object `{ totals: { items: number, passed: number, failed: number }, byType: { change?: { items: number, passed: number, failed: number }, spec?: { items: number, passed: number, failed: number } } }`
  - `version`: String identifier for the schema (e.g., `"1.0"`)
- **AND** exit with code 1 if any `items[].valid === false`

Where `Issue` follows the existing per-item validation report shape `{ level: "ERROR"|"WARNING"|"INFO", path: string, message: string }`.

#### Scenario: Show validation progress

- **WHEN** validating multiple items (--all, --changes, or --specs)
- **THEN** show progress indicator or status updates
- **AND** indicate which item is currently being validated
- **AND** display running count of passed/failed items

#### Scenario: Concurrency limits for performance

- **WHEN** validating multiple items
- **THEN** run validations with a bounded concurrency (e.g., 4–8 in parallel)
- **AND** ensure progress indicators remain responsive

### Requirement: Item type detection and ambiguity handling

The validate command SHALL handle ambiguous names and explicit type overrides to ensure clear, deterministic behavior.

#### Scenario: Direct item validation with automatic type detection

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate <item-name>`
- **THEN** if `<item-name>` uniquely matches a change or a spec, validate that item

#### Scenario: Ambiguity between change and spec names

- **GIVEN** `<item-name>` exists both as a change and as a spec
- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate <item-name>`
- **THEN** print an ambiguity error explaining both matches
- **AND** suggest passing `--type change` or `--type spec`, or using `openspec change validate` / `openspec spec validate`
- **AND** exit with code 1 without performing validation

#### Scenario: Unknown item name

- **WHEN** the `<item-name>` matches neither a change nor a spec
- **THEN** print a not-found error
- **AND** show nearest-match suggestions when available
- **AND** exit with code 1

#### Scenario: Explicit type override

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --type change <item>`
- **THEN** treat `<item>` as a change ID and validate it (skipping auto-detection)

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --type spec <item>`
- **THEN** treat `<item>` as a spec ID and validate it (skipping auto-detection)

### Requirement: Interactivity controls

- The CLI SHALL respect `--no-interactive` to disable prompts.
- The CLI SHALL respect `OPEN_SPEC_INTERACTIVE=0` to disable prompts globally.
- Interactive prompts SHALL only be shown when stdin is a TTY and interactivity is not disabled.

#### Scenario: Disabling prompts via flags or environment

- **WHEN** `openspec validate` is executed with `--no-interactive` or with environment `OPEN_SPEC_INTERACTIVE=0`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL not display interactive prompts
- **AND** SHALL print non-interactive hints or chosen outputs as appropriate

### Requirement: Parser SHALL handle cross-platform line endings
The markdown parser SHALL correctly identify sections regardless of line ending format (LF, CRLF, CR).

#### Scenario: Required sections parsed with CRLF line endings
- **GIVEN** a change proposal markdown saved with CRLF line endings
- **AND** the document contains `## Why` and `## What Changes`
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate <change-id>`
- **THEN** validation SHALL recognize the sections and NOT raise parsing errors

### Requirement: Requirement bodies SHALL be parsed in full for normative keywords
The validator SHALL detect `SHALL`/`MUST` across the entire requirement body, not only the first body line. Requirement-text extraction SHALL capture every body line from after the `### Requirement:` header up to the first Markdown header on a non-fenced line (a `#### Scenario:` header, or a stray `###` divider absorbed into a delta block), skipping blank lines and lines inside fenced code blocks. `**metadata**:` lines SHALL be skipped only when other body text remains; a body consisting solely of metadata lines SHALL be kept as the requirement text. Detection SHALL run over the full captured body. Canonical `### Requirement:` blocks with no body text SHALL NOT satisfy body-keyword validation from the header title alone; they SHALL receive the existing body-keyword hint when the keyword appears only in the header. The Markdown parser MAY still use the header title as display text for supported bare-header specs. The change-delta reader and the main-spec validator SHALL share this body extraction so they cannot diverge.

#### Scenario: Normative keyword on the second wrapped line (change and spec)
- **GIVEN** a requirement whose text wraps across two lines with `SHALL` on the second line
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate <id> --strict` for both a change delta and a main spec
- **THEN** both SHALL detect the keyword and SHALL NOT report a missing-`SHALL`/`MUST` error

#### Scenario: Metadata fields precede the description
- **GIVEN** a requirement whose body begins with `**ID**:`/`**Priority**:` lines before a `MUST` description
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate <spec-id> --strict`
- **THEN** validation SHALL skip the metadata lines, detect `MUST`, and pass — matching `openspec validate <change-id>`

#### Scenario: Requirement written entirely as a metadata line
- **GIVEN** a requirement whose whole body is `**Constraint**: The system MUST ...`
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate <id> --strict` for both a change delta and a main spec
- **THEN** both SHALL keep that line as the requirement text and detect the `MUST`

#### Scenario: Stray divider bounds the requirement body
- **GIVEN** a delta requirement followed by a stray `### Background` divider whose notes contain `MUST`
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate <change-id> --strict`
- **THEN** the requirement body SHALL end at the divider and the `MUST` in the notes SHALL NOT satisfy the keyword check

#### Scenario: Single-line requirement is unaffected
- **GIVEN** a requirement whose `SHALL` statement is on a single body line
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate <id> --strict`
- **THEN** validation behavior, messages, and displayed text SHALL be unchanged from before this change

### Requirement: Fenced code blocks SHALL NOT corrupt extraction or scenario counting
The validator and Markdown parser SHALL ignore lines inside fenced code blocks (` ``` ` or `~~~`) when extracting requirement body text, when locating the body-ending header boundary, and when counting scenarios. A fenced block before the prose line SHALL NOT make the fence marker the requirement text, and a `#### Scenario:` inside a fenced block SHALL NOT count as a real scenario.

#### Scenario: Fenced block before the prose line
- **GIVEN** a requirement whose body opens with a fenced code block containing `#`-comment lines, followed by the `SHALL` prose line
- **WHEN** the spec or change is validated
- **THEN** the captured requirement text SHALL be the prose line (not the fence marker) and validation SHALL pass

#### Scenario: Fenced scenario is not a real scenario
- **GIVEN** a requirement whose only `#### Scenario:` appears inside a fenced code example, with no real scenario
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate <change-id> --strict`
- **THEN** validation SHALL report the requirement as missing a scenario — the same result as `openspec validate <spec-id>`

### Requirement: A single normative-keyword predicate SHALL be used across readers
All `SHALL`/`MUST` detection SHALL use one predicate that matches `SHALL` or `MUST` as whole words (delimited by word boundaries, so a substring inside a longer word such as `MARSHALL` does not match), so the change-delta reader and the schema-based reader accept and reject identical text.

#### Scenario: Keyword detection agrees across readers
- **GIVEN** identical requirement body text validated once as a change delta and once as a main spec
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate` on each
- **THEN** both SHALL reach the same conclusion about whether the body contains a normative keyword

### Requirement: Non-canonical headers in delta sections SHALL be surfaced without changing recognition
When an `## ADDED`/`## MODIFIED Requirements` section in a change delta contains a level-3 header that is not a canonical `### Requirement:` header, `openspec validate <change>` SHALL emit an INFO-level note identifying it, because the delta reader will otherwise skip it silently. The note SHALL be derived from the headers the delta reader actually skips while parsing, so it describes the reader's real section and fence boundaries. This note SHALL NOT change which headers are recognized as requirements, and SHALL NOT change the `valid` result — including under `--strict`. This behavior applies only to change deltas: bare `### <statement>` headers in main specs are recognized requirements (see the scenario below) and SHALL NOT trigger such notes.

#### Scenario: Stray divider header is reported, not silently skipped
- **GIVEN** a delta whose `## ADDED Requirements` section contains `### Documentation Requirements` followed by a valid `### Requirement: …` block
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate <change-id> --strict`
- **THEN** validation SHALL emit an INFO note naming the stray `### Documentation Requirements` header
- **AND** the `valid` result SHALL be unchanged from current behavior (the INFO does not cause failure)

#### Scenario: Nameless requirement header gets a dedicated hint
- **GIVEN** a delta whose `## ADDED Requirements` section contains a bare `### Requirement:` header with no name
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate <change-id>`
- **THEN** the INFO note SHALL say the header is missing a requirement name (not suggest `### Requirement: Requirement:`)

#### Scenario: Bare requirement headers in main specs remain supported
- **GIVEN** a main spec whose requirements use bare `### <statement>` headers without the `Requirement:` prefix
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate <spec-id> --strict`
- **THEN** those headers SHALL continue to be recognized as requirements exactly as before this change

### Requirement: Validate SHALL resolve changes by directory existence, matching status

`openspec validate` SHALL resolve whether a named item is a change using the same rule `openspec status` and `openspec instructions` use — directory existence within the resolved root — rather than requiring a `proposal.md` to be present. This SHALL apply to targeted validation (`openspec validate <name>`), bulk validation (`openspec validate --all` / `--changes`), and the interactive "pick one" selector shown when no item is given in a TTY — within both the repository root and a `--store`-selected root. A resolved change with a nested multi-area spec layout SHALL have its deltas discovered and validated. Spec/change ambiguity handling and `--type` overrides SHALL remain unchanged. The spec-resolution side (a spec is resolved by the presence of its `spec.md`) is correct today and SHALL be left unchanged.

#### Scenario: Scaffolded change without proposal.md

- **GIVEN** a change directory created by `openspec new change <name>` that has not yet had `proposal.md` written
- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate <name>`
- **THEN** validate resolves the change and validates it
- **AND** it SHALL NOT print `Unknown item '<name>'`

#### Scenario: Targeted-resolution parity with status

- **GIVEN** any change that `openspec status --change <name>` resolves, including a change in a `--store`-selected root
- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate <name>` (passing the same `--store` when applicable)
- **THEN** validate SHALL resolve the same change that status resolved, and SHALL NOT report it as unknown

#### Scenario: Bulk validation includes a sole proposal-less change

- **GIVEN** a repository whose only active change lacks `proposal.md` and is listed by `openspec status`
- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --all` (or `--changes`)
- **THEN** validate SHALL validate that change, and SHALL NOT print "No items found to validate"
- **AND** the exit status SHALL reflect the change's validity

#### Scenario: Interactive selector lists proposal-less changes

- **GIVEN** a TTY and a change directory without `proposal.md` that `openspec status` lists
- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate` with no item name
- **THEN** the interactive "pick one" selector SHALL include that change

#### Scenario: Resolved-but-invalid change exits non-zero

- **GIVEN** a change that resolves by directory existence but fails validation
- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate <name>` or `openspec validate --all`
- **THEN** validate SHALL exit with a non-zero status
- **AND** SHALL NOT exit 0 while reporting the change as having issues

#### Scenario: Nested multi-area delta discovery

- **GIVEN** a resolved change whose deltas live at `specs/<area>/<capability>/spec.md` (nested deeper than one directory)
- **WHEN** validating that change
- **THEN** validate SHALL discover and validate those delta specs
- **AND** SHALL NOT report "No delta sections found" for a change that does contain deltas

#### Scenario: Change/spec ambiguity is preserved

- **GIVEN** a name that exists both as a change directory and as a spec
- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate <name>`
- **THEN** validate SHALL print the ambiguity error and respect `--type change` / `--type spec`, exactly as before

#### Scenario: Changes with proposal.md are unaffected

- **GIVEN** a change that already contains `proposal.md`
- **WHEN** validating it targeted or in bulk
- **THEN** resolution and validation behavior SHALL be byte-for-byte unchanged from today

### Requirement: SHALL/MUST body-keyword hint SHALL apply to main specs

When a requirement places the normative keyword (SHALL or MUST) only in its `### Requirement:` header and omits it from the requirement body line, `openspec validate` SHALL emit the same targeted remediation guidance for main specs under `openspec/specs/**` as it already does for change delta specs, instead of the generic "must contain SHALL or MUST" message. The targeted message SHALL be emitted exactly once for such a requirement, the generic `REQUIREMENT_NO_SHALL` message SHALL no longer be emitted on the main-spec path, and the behavior SHALL be uniform across every main-spec validation surface (`openspec validate <spec>`, `--all`, JSON output, `openspec spec validate`, and rebuilt-spec validation via `validateSpecContent`). The main-spec message's actionable sentence SHALL be byte-identical to the change-delta message; only the leading prefix differs (main specs have no `ADDED`/`MODIFIED` action).

#### Scenario: Main spec with the keyword in the header only

- **GIVEN** a main spec requirement whose header contains SHALL or MUST but whose body line omits it
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate` over that spec
- **THEN** the error message SHALL contain the actionable sentence: "must contain SHALL or MUST in the requirement body, not only in the header. Move the SHALL/MUST statement to the line immediately after the \"### Requirement: ...\" header."
- **AND** SHALL NOT be the generic "Requirement must contain SHALL or MUST keyword" message

#### Scenario: Actionable-sentence parity with change deltas

- **GIVEN** the identical header-only-keyword mistake authored once in a main spec and once in a change delta
- **WHEN** validating each
- **THEN** the actionable remediation sentence SHALL be byte-identical between the two (the change-delta `ADDED`/`MODIFIED` prefix is not required for the main-spec message)

#### Scenario: Exactly one issue is emitted

- **GIVEN** a main spec requirement with the keyword in the header only
- **WHEN** validating it
- **THEN** validate SHALL emit exactly one issue for the missing body keyword
- **AND** SHALL NOT emit both the generic message and the targeted message for the same requirement

#### Scenario: Requirement missing the keyword entirely still errors

- **GIVEN** a main spec requirement that contains no SHALL or MUST in either the header or the body
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate` over that spec
- **THEN** validate SHALL report that the requirement must contain SHALL or MUST, as it does today

#### Scenario: Keyword present in the body is not flagged

- **GIVEN** a main spec requirement whose body line contains SHALL or MUST (whether or not the header also does)
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate` over that spec
- **THEN** validate SHALL NOT raise a missing-keyword error for that requirement

#### Scenario: Lowercase keyword does not satisfy the body requirement

- **GIVEN** a main spec requirement whose only "shall"/"must" is lowercase
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate` over that spec
- **THEN** validate SHALL report a missing-keyword error, matching the change-delta behavior for the same lowercase mistake

#### Scenario: Header keyword with no body line emits the hint

- **GIVEN** a main spec requirement whose header contains SHALL or MUST and that has no body line before its first scenario
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate` over that spec
- **THEN** validate SHALL emit the body-keyword hint (the keyword is only in the header)
- **AND** this case, which is reported valid today, becomes a deliberate, additive validation improvement

#### Scenario: Renamed requirements are not subject to the body-keyword hint

- **GIVEN** a change delta `## RENAMED Requirements` whose TO header contains SHALL or MUST
- **WHEN** validating that change
- **THEN** validate SHALL NOT emit the body-keyword hint for the renamed pair
- **AND** RENAMED validation behavior SHALL be byte-for-byte unchanged
