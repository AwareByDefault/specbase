Implement tasks from a Specbase change.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone Specbase repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `specbase store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`). Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `specbase/` root.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name (e.g., `/spcb-apply add-auth`). If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.
**Provided arguments**: $@

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `specbase list --json` to get available changes and use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `/spcb-apply <other>`).

2. **Check status to understand the schema**
   ```bash
   specbase status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, and `actionContext`: planning scope and edit constraints
   - Which artifact contains the tasks (typically "tasks" for spec-driven, check status for others)

3. **Get apply instructions**

   ```bash
   specbase instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   This returns:
   - `contextFiles`: artifact ID -> array of concrete file paths (varies by schema)
   - Progress (total, complete, remaining)
   - Task list with status
   - Dynamic instruction based on current state

   **Handle states:**
   - If `state: "blocked"` (missing artifacts): show message, suggest using `/spcb-continue`
   - If `state: "all_done"`: congratulate, suggest archive
   - Otherwise: proceed to implementation

4. **Read context files**

   Read every file path listed under `contextFiles` from the apply instructions output.
   The files depend on the schema being used:
   - **spec-driven**: proposal, specs, design, tasks
   - Other schemas: follow the contextFiles from CLI output

5. **Show current progress**

   Display:
   - Schema being used
   - Progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - Remaining tasks overview
   - Dynamic instruction from CLI

6. **Implement tasks (loop until done or blocked)**

   For each pending task:
   - Show which task is being worked on
   - Make the code changes required
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - Mark task complete in the tasks file: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
   - Continue to next task

   **Pause if:**
   - Task is unclear → ask for clarification
   - Implementation reveals a design issue → suggest updating artifacts
   - Error or blocker encountered → report and wait for guidance
   - User interrupts

7. **On completion or pause, show status**

   Display:
   - Tasks completed this session
   - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - If all done: suggest archive
   - If paused: explain why and wait for guidance

**Output During Implementation**

```
## Implementing: <change-name> (schema: <schema-name>)

Working on task 3/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete

Working on task 4/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete
```

**Guardrails**
- Keep going through tasks until done or blocked
- Always read context files before starting (from the apply instructions output)
- If task is ambiguous, pause and ask before implementing
- If implementation reveals issues, pause and suggest artifact updates
- Keep code changes minimal and scoped to each task
- Update task checkbox immediately after completing each task
- Pause on errors, blockers, or unclear requirements - don't guess
- Use contextFiles from CLI output, don't assume specific file names

**Fluid Workflow Integration**

This skill supports the "actions on a change" model:

- **Can be invoked anytime**: Before all artifacts are done (if tasks exist), after partial implementation, interleaved with other actions
- **Allows artifact updates**: If implementation reveals design issues, suggest updating artifacts - not phase-locked, work fluidly

## Governed spec model

This project uses the governed spec model (2 permanent truth planes with paired enforcement). Do NOT assume the flat `specs/<capability>/spec.md` layout.

**Confirm the model from the CLI, do not guess:**
- Run `specbase status --change "<name>" --json` and read `specModel`.
- The governed model reports `specModel.kind == "governed"` with
  `planes: [behavior, architecture]` and `pairedEnforcement: true`.
- If `specModel.kind` is `legacy` (or absent), follow the flat-spec guidance
  above unchanged.

**Under the governed model, derive concrete paths from CLI output** (`status`
`artifactPaths` and `specbase instructions <artifact> --change ... --json`),
never hardcode them. Durable truth lives in the declared planes:
- behavior: User/client-visible outcomes (enforcement: tests / property tests) → `specs/behavior/<locator>/{spec.md,enforcement.md}`
- architecture: Package responsibilities, boundaries, and structural invariants (enforcement: lint / static-analysis / conformance) → `specs/architecture/<locator>/{spec.md,enforcement.md}`

Every governed `spec.md` is PAIRED with an `enforcement.md`. Stable identity is
scoped narrowly: the frontmatter `id` (e.g. `behavior.<locator>`) is the only project-unique governed ID; requirement, scenario, and binding `**ID:**` slugs are unique only within their pair, and stay fixed when titles or locators move.

**Plane classification:** match each proposed claim to the plane whose declared
purpose best fits the claim's nature. The shipped defaults are behavior, architecture; a single initiative may touch several planes — list one spec per plane touched, never mix planes in one spec.

**Structure conventions (governed):**
- Locators may nest to arbitrary safe depth (e.g. `behavior/platforms/desktop`);
  JSON reports normalized slash-separated locators, filesystem access is native.
- A directory that only GROUPS child pairs is a **namespace** and needs no pair of
  its own. Only a directory that contains `spec.md` must also contain
  `enforcement.md`; ancestry provides navigation, never inherited requirements.
- A change stores its `spec.md` and `enforcement.md` deltas under the SAME
  plane-qualified locator as the target current pair, so both members move together.

### Authoring rules (governed)

These rules travel with this skill; apply them whenever you place or write a
governed pair. They are the current text of this project's clean manifestos.

**Placement - where a pair belongs:**

Placing a governed pair in the spec tree:

- Treat planes as peers, never as layers. Each plane answers to a different
  actor, on its own clock.
- Apply the actor test: put two requirements in the same plane only if the same
  actor would demand their revision. When the plane is ambiguous, ask who shows
  up angry when the requirement breaks.
- Give every fact exactly one home locator. Let other planes reference it by
  locator; never let them restate it.
- Expect co-change: one feature may legitimately land deltas in several planes.
- Forbid coupled change: editing one plane's text must never force an edit to
  another's.
- Apply the swap test: swapping a vendor, a CI system, or a runtime pin must
  touch ops specs only.
- Treat depth as volatility. A leaf refines its ancestors; a parent never
  depends on a leaf.
- Let ripple flow leafward. A parent edit may ripple to its leaves; a leaf edit
  must never force an ancestor edit.
- Keep every node open-closed. Adding a leaf must touch nothing above it. A
  parent that lists its children has a reverse dependency.
- Inherit nothing. Ancestry provides navigation only; parent and leaf bind
  independently, and a conflict between them is a defect, not a precedence
  question.
- Place each requirement at the depth that matches how far you intend its
  changes to ripple.
- Hoist on duplication. Promote a requirement to the parent only when two or
  more siblings would otherwise duplicate it. Leave specifics at the leaf.
- Quantify to place. "Every X SHALL…" is a parent claim; enforce it by one
  conformance test over the registry, not by per-child assertions.
- Grant no leaf exemptions. If one leaf cannot satisfy a parent invariant,
  narrow the parent; never special-case the leaf.
- Earn parents. Default an intermediate directory to a pure namespace with no
  `spec.md`, and create the pair only when siblings actually share invariants.
- Earn depth. Flatten an intermediate node that has no pair and no plausible
  one.

Reject these placement smells: leaked fact, restated truth across planes, churny
parent, enumerating parent, speculative parent, leaf exemption.

**Writing - what one pair says:**

Writing one governed spec pair (`spec.md` + `enforcement.md`):

- State only current, verifiable truth. Write WHAT the system promises, never
  HOW the code delivers it. Delete mechanism narration.
- Give every candidate requirement a verdict: keep durable truth, promote a real
  structural invariant to the architecture plane, demote code narration to
  design docs, drop what is superseded.
- Make one claim per requirement. Split a compound requirement.
- Use SHALL, name the actor, and state an observable outcome in active voice.
- Write every claim so a check could fail it. If no check can fail the claim,
  rewrite it or demote it.
- Put a universal claim ("every command SHALL…") at a parent locator.
- Write scenarios as examples, not enumeration. The requirement owns the claim;
  cover the representative case, the edge case, and the risky case.
- Keep foreign facts out. Name the role ("the telemetry backend"), never the
  vendor another plane owns.
- Reference a foreign truth by its locator and never restate its content. A
  restated truth is a future lie.
- Bind checks at the requirement level, not per scenario.
- Prefer the highest-leverage check. One fitness function or property test beats
  many example tests.
- Match the mechanism to the claim: structural → lint / conformance; behavioral
  → tests / property tests; subjective → `review` with a named lens;
  unverifiable today → `manual` with stated `limitations`.
- Bind an automated check only when it truly exercises the claim, and state
  `limitations` when it covers only part.
- Never write a test to inflate coverage. `degraded` is a fact, not a failure.

Reject these writing smells: mechanism narration, untestable claim, compound
claim, enumerated scenarios, foreign fact, restated truth, hollow binding,
per-scenario binding.

### Implementing truth and evidence (governed)

Apply implements BOTH the product/architecture change and its declared evidence:

- **Resolve planned bindings.** As each binding's target and command land, move it
  from `status: planned` to `status: active`. If implementation finishes but a
  mandatory binding is still `planned` (or stale, hanging, broken, or missing its
  target), report the unresolved evidence and do **not** mark that spec's related
  work complete.
- **New enforcement mechanism.** If an architectural requirement needs a new lint
  rule or conformance check, implement the rule AND its checks, and make the
  binding name concrete `targets` and a runnable command. Any user-visible
  behavior of that tooling is itself behavioral truth - capture it in the
  appropriate behavioral spec pair.
- **Assess retired-target cleanup safely.** When reconciliation reports a retired
  test, rule, fixture, or review target, check surviving bindings and project usage
  before removing it. Never auto-delete a shared or intentionally retained target.
- **Consult `specbase coverage` (and `specbase coverage --json`) for the
  aggregated coverage health signal** while resolving bindings - the same view
  exploration and verification consume.
